### Is there a Pokédex document I can refer to?

The game's data files do a fairly good job of listing things you'll want to know.

* [Base stats and TM learnsets](data/pokemon/base_stats/)
* [Level-up learnsets and evolution methods](data/pokemon/evos_attacks.asm)
* [Egg moves](data/pokemon/egg_moves.asm)
* [Move attributes](data/moves/moves.asm)
* [TM+HM+tutor list](data/moves/tmhm_moves.asm)
* [Wild Pokémon](data/wild/)


### How do I evolve my Pokémon?

* Item trade evolutions (like Seadra into Kingdra while holding a Dragon Scale) now evolve while holding the item.

### What do blessings and photographs do?

Daily blessings in Ecruteak City and photographs in Cianwood City make your Pokémon happier, just like haircuts or grooming.


### I don't like non-canon Pokémon types!

I was hesitant to make original changes like this, because the goal is to be an improved Crystal version, not a new game. In the end I made two versions, one regular (with changes) and one "faithful" (with original typings).
